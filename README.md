Keywords: Gulf of Mexico, river chemistry, nutrients, discharge, ocean properties

Data sources include the Water Quality Portal, United States Geological Survey, Gulf of Mexico Coastal Ocean Observing System, and NASAâ€™s OceanColor Web.

The WRTDS model from the EGRET R package (Hirsch & De Cicco, 2015) was used to estimate daily river chemical solute concentrations and fluxes. The R programming language was used to create this database.

Here is the link to the database: https://zenodo.org/records/10152141

This repository includes the R script used to mine, clean, run through the WRTDS model, and QA/QC the river chemistry, discharge, and flux data.
